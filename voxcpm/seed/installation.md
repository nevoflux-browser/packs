# VoxCPM Installation

For the authoritative CLI flag table, see `voxcpm/cli-reference`. This page only covers
getting VoxCPM installed and confirming it works — not what flags do.

## Install

Pick one:

```bash
# pip
pip install voxcpm

# uv
uv pip install voxcpm
```

### From source (required for fine-tuning)

The pip/uv wheel does **not** include the `scripts/` and `conf/` directories that fine-tuning
needs. If you plan to fine-tune, install from a source checkout instead:

```bash
git clone <voxcpm-repo-url>
cd voxcpm
uv sync            # or: pip install -e .
```

Record the checkout path in `voxcpm/environment` under "源码 checkout" once you have one —
its absence there means fine-tuning workflows are unavailable on this machine.

## Dependencies

- **PyTorch ≥ 2.5.0** — required.
- **CUDA 12.0+** — optional. Only needed for GPU inference; CPU and MPS backends don't need
  it (see `--device` in `voxcpm/cli-reference`).
- **FFmpeg** — must be installed at the system level (not just as a Python package). Without
  it, the audio backend errors out at load or decode time.

## Python version

Official guidance recommends **Python 3.10–3.11**, and the upstream README states `<3.13`.
**However, 3.13.5 has been verified to work in practice** — this pack's own reference
environment runs voxcpm 2.0.3 on Python 3.13.5 with no issues. Do not treat "Python 3.13" by
itself as a reason something is broken. That said, if you hit an installation or runtime
problem and the Python version doesn't match the officially-recommended 3.10–3.11 range,
**Python version mismatch should be your first suspect** before digging elsewhere.

## Model download

Model weights are downloaded automatically from Hugging Face on first use. If you're in a
region where Hugging Face is slow or blocked, redirect downloads through a mirror:

```bash
export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
```

## Disk space

Model weights are several GB — make sure the cache directory (`--cache-dir`, see
`voxcpm/cli-reference`) has room before the first run.

## Verifying the install

```bash
voxcpm --help
```

Use `voxcpm --help`, **not** `voxcpm --version` — there is no `--version` flag; passing it
fails with `unrecognized arguments`. A successful `--help` listing is the install-verification
signal this pack relies on everywhere (see `voxcpm/troubleshooting` for why `python -c "import
voxcpm"` is not a substitute for this check).
